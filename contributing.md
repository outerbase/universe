## Code of Conduct

To quote the famous William and Theodore:

"Be excellent to each other."
<br /><br />

## Questions

If you have any questions feel free to utilize our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/4M6AXzGG84) or the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Outerbase/universe/discussions) board.
<br /><br />

## Feature Requests

Please create a new GitHub issue for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Please provide the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it will work. Discuss your ideas transparently and get community feedback before proceeding.

Major Changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an GitHub issue that clearly outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.

Small Changes can directly be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a Pull Request. See the section about Pull Request Submission Guidelines, and for detailed information the core development documentation.

## Reporting Bugs

**If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@outerbase.com instead.**

Before you submit your issue, please [search the issue archive](https://github.com/Outerbase/universe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) - maybe your question or issue has already been identified or addressed.

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue to our GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Outerbase/universe/issues). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix!

_More contribution guidelines around code contribution and PR guidelines coming soon._
